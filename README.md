I have created a trivia game based off the hit TV show Grey's Anatomy.

There are three different difficulties to choose from with question amount and difficulty ranging with the selected difficulty. 

All the code is organized in dedicated files to keep everything organized.

Currently this only runs in a terminal window. Assistance is needed with how to give this a window to operate from.
